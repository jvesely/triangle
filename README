This program is a course assignment for Linear Programming (CS521) class
at Rutgers University, Fall '14.
It implements Triangle algorithm for convex hull problem.

The program expects input on standard input (or redirected from a file)
The first value is number of dimensions - N. That is followed by N*X values
representing vertices. The input ends with Origin (zero vector).
Values only need to be separated by whitespace so feel free to align in any way.
See test folder for examples.

Example invocation:
./triangle < test/square


Compiling:
Makefile is included with standard targets (all, clean).
The program need boost library and was developed against version 1.54 of this
library. This program uses C++13 features and thus requires a fairly recent
compiler (gcc, llvm has compile options issues).
To compile the program just type:
make
